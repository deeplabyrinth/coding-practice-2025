### Roll the Die Game
In this challenge, you'll exercise your knowledge of loops by creating a Roll the Die game. The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls. Note that a die has 6 sides, and each side contains a number between 1 and 6.

#### Task
* Your program will automatically roll the die and advance the player that number of spaces on the game board.
* Repeat this up to 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.
* After 5 rolls, if they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose. Otherwise they win.
* If the player gets to exactly 20 before five rolls, end the game. They've won.
