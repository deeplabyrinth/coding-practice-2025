# Java Basics 
A collection of labs and challenges I solved while learning Java. Each foundational concept is organized in its own folder, containing the lab and personal notes. The concepts I learned are as follows:

- Basics such as packages, classes, main entry point, and reserved words
- Variables
- Decision structures
- Repetition structures
- Methods
- Objects
- Arrays
- Text processing (strings, text blocks)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Data structures
- Functional programming
- Exception handling
