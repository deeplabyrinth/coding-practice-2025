### Fill in the Blank
In this challenge, you'll create a fill-in-the-blank story program where the blanks are filled by variables.

#### Challenges I faced
* Wrongly used the protected access modifiers for Answer methods and fields
* Main resides within its own class and cannot directly access protected members of a different class

#### Successes
* Used the .format method to interpolate between variables and placeholders within a text block (Java 15)
