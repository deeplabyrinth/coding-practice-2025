### Change for a Dollar Game
In this challenge, you're going to make a game. The objective of the game is to enter enough change to equal exactly one U.S. dollar.

#### Task
Accept the quantity of each coin the player wants to submit and count the total value of the coins. If the value of the coins equals exactly one U.S. dollar (1.00), then they win the game. If it's more or less than one U.S. dollar, then they lose the game.

#### Challenges I faced
* Tried to use a switch statement to evaluate a double
* Tried to use a switch statement to evaluate a boolean
* Switch statements differ from if-else-if statements by checking for equality instead of a boolean valuee.
* Switch expressions differ from switch statements - They directly assign a value to a variable when a case is matched
* Floats, longs, doubles, and booleans are not allowed in the switch statements
