###### Identify the method's name

There is one method within this class. Identify the method's name.

###### Challenges I faced

* Tried to replicate the structure of the lab
* Used an assertion statement in Main to test the answer returned by the getMethodName method from external class (Answer)
* Despite the assertion check failing, values matched, resorted to if-else statement instead
* The problem with the assertion check seems to be under the hood, something beyond my knowledge

###### Successes

* Used static access modifiers in both Main and Answer which allowed calling a method from a different class without instantiating an object associated with it
