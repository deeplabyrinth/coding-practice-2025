# Coding Practice 2025
A collection of different programming concepts that I learned in the summer of 2025 during my break from school. The goal is to become fluent enough in Java and Go in order to learn how to scale an application. Many of the labs in the following repository are provided by the various online courses that I deemed worth learning from (mainly from Java champions or professionals with good communication skills with a ton of experience).

Programming is an art that is difficult to grasp. A lot of time will be spent exploring all the different learning resources out there. Unfortunately, most of the exercises provide code for you to fill-in-the-blanks and don't offer a more constructive way of learning. Try to read what the labs demand, the code the lab yourself, before filling in the blanks that the lab wants you to do.
